### Introduction

> Computer programming is the capstone of Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing.
>
> If you have an interest in _really_ understanding advanced manufacturing, then
> you will need excellent computer programming skills.

An **Industrial Learning Pathway** is a collection of freely-available, web-based
resources for onboarding students and existing industrial professionals into
various traditional or advanced manufacturing topics of interest.

This pathway focuses on Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing.

Priority is also given to resources that contain open-sourced code and
written content that is open via a [Creative Commons license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license)
or similar. That ensures maximum reusability outside of an educational
context if desirable.

These resources also focus on "industrial" contexts like using computer programming
in pursuit of physical product engineering, systems engineering and/or
manufacturing. However, most of the material can be used if you are precisely
interested in these fields.

It is important to realize if you are a beginner that industrial programming and
industrial technologies are quite diverse and sometimes obscure.

It is not unusual to encounter a manufacturing floor with various types, brands and
generations of industrial controllers and computers running a variety of
proprietary pieces of software - working together in a delicate ballet of
production that must be kept going at all costs. Some of the resources herein
will attempt to demystify some of these legacy and proprietary technologies
where appropriate (and if possible).

In contrast to that, manufacturing is headed into new directions more recently -
in particular, embracing a more "end-to-end digital" viewpoint. This movement
is called Industry 4.0 or Smart Manufacturing at times.

The good news is that manufacturers have become wary of proprietary standards and
communication protocols in pursuit of a more interoperable factory floor in part.
Additionally and by necessity in many cases, the factory floor is embracing
open-source software to performs Data Analytics, IIoT edge computing, embedded design
and Artificial Intelligence work.

You will also notice that no one programming language (industrial or not) **always**
dominates the entire field. Certain technologies and languages have their strong
suit depending on what you are trying to accomplish. We will try to demystify that
as well.

Check out each topic area below. If you are a beginner and want to explore a
particular language, check out the "Foundations" or "for Beginners" sections.
For more intermediate/advanced audiences, the "Virtual Conference" sections might be a
more fruitful area to check out.

For each section, there is a corresponding playlist on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/smevirtual).
The videos in these playlists are kept in order so that beginners or other
interested people can watch them from start-to-finish without having to jump
around.

As always, we are open to feedback (good or bad), feel free to file a [new issue](https://github.com/smevirtual/industry40_learning_pathway/issues/new)
or reach out to the current Open Source Lead using the information below.

### Python for Beginners

#### Before You Begin

Coming soon!

#### Overview

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a great general programming language that is very popular
across a wide-variety of domains. In some measurements, it is _the_ most
popular programming language. Python is an excellent choice to start
with if you have never programmed before with its clear and clean syntax,
emphasis on code readability and vast amount reusable libraries.

Python likely has one of the richest open-source ecosystem of libraries
for physical engineering and manufacturing work at the moment.

#### Typical Industrial Use Cases

- Numerical computing and computational geometry (e.g. PCB layouts, path planning)
- Robotics design analysis and programming
- Discrete simulation (e.g. process simulation)
- Data Science
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Vision
- Server-side web applications

### TypeScript for Beginners

#### Before You Begin

Coming soon!

#### Overview

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a programming language that is
developed and maintained primarily by Microsoft. It is a strict superset of
JavaScript (a core technology of the World Wide Web) and adds optional
static typing. Given its enhanced feature set and design, TypeScript is arguably
a better choice for large web applications over Vanilla JavaScript and large
applications are not uncommon in engineering and manufacturing.

TypeScript has design traits that make it similar to C# (another language developed
and maintained by Microsoft) as both TypeScript and C# share the same language
designer - [Anders Hejlsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg).

The popularity of TypeScript is [rising rapidly](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/10-most-popular-programming-languages-rise-of-typescript/) and it may very well,
one day, become as popular as JavaScript itself.

#### Typical Industrial Use Cases

- Frontend web applications (i.e. constructing interactive data charts in the browser)
- Server-side web applications (via [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/))
