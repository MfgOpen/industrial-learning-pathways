### Introduction

> Computer programming is the capstone of Industry 4.0, Smart Manufacturing and modern Systems Engineering.
>
> If you have an interest in _really_ understanding advanced manufacturing and modern, connected systems, then you will
> need excellent computer programming skills.

An **Industrial Learning Pathway** is a collection of freely-available, web-based resources for onboarding students and
existing industrial professionals into various traditional or advanced engineering and manufacturing topics of interest.

Priority is also given to resources that contain open-sourced code and written content that is open via a
[Creative Commons license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license) or similar. That ensures maximum
reusability outside of an educational context if desirable.

These resources also focus on "industrial" contexts like using computer programming in pursuit of physical product
engineering, systems engineering and/or manufacturing. However, most of the material can be used if you are precisely
interested in these fields.

It is important to realize if you are a beginner that industrial programming and industrial technologies are quite
diverse and sometimes obscure.

It is not unusual to encounter a manufacturing floor with various types, brands and generations of industrial
controllers and computers running a variety of proprietary pieces of software - working together in a delicate ballet of
production that must be kept going at all costs. Some of the resources herein will attempt to demystify some of these
legacy and proprietary technologies where appropriate (and if possible).

In contrast to that, manufacturing is headed into new directions more recently - in particular, embracing a more
"end-to-end digital" viewpoint. This movement is called Industry 4.0 or Smart Manufacturing at times.

The good news is that manufacturers have become wary of proprietary standards and communication protocols in pursuit of
a more interoperable factory floor in part. Additionally and by necessity in many cases, the factory floor is embracing
open-source software to performs Data Analytics, IIoT edge computing, embedded design and Artificial Intelligence work.

You will also notice that no one programming language (industrial or not) **always** dominates the entire field. Certain
technologies and languages have their strong suit depending on what you are trying to accomplish. This resource will try
to demystify that as well.

For each section, there is a corresponding playlist on our
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnFzh0wAAI1JimM9YvaK8uw). The videos in these playlists are kept in
order so that beginners or other interested people can watch them from start-to-finish without having to jump around.

As always, we are open to feedback (good or bad), feel free to file a
[new issue](https://github.com/MfgOpen/industrial-learning-pathways/issues/new) or reach out to the current Open Source
Lead using the information below.

### Python Programming

#### Before You Begin

Coming soon!

#### Overview

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a great general programming language that is very popular across a wide-variety of
domains. In some measurements, it is _the_ most popular programming language. Python is an excellent choice to start
with if you have never programmed before with its clear and clean syntax, emphasis on code readability and vast amount
reusable libraries.

Python likely has one of the richest open-source ecosystem of libraries for physical engineering and manufacturing work
at the moment.

#### Typical Industrial Use Cases

- Numerical computing and computational geometry (e.g. PCB layouts, path planning)
- Robotics design analysis and programming
- Discrete simulation (e.g. process simulation)
- Data Science
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Vision
- Server-side web applications

### TypeScript Programming

#### Before You Begin

Coming soon!

#### Overview

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a programming language that is developed and maintained primarily by
Microsoft. It is a strict superset of JavaScript (a core technology of the World Wide Web) and adds optional static
typing. Given its enhanced feature set and design, TypeScript is arguably a better choice for large web applications
over Vanilla JavaScript and large applications are not uncommon in engineering and manufacturing.

TypeScript has design traits that make it similar to C# (another language developed and maintained by Microsoft) as both
TypeScript and C# share the same language designer - [Anders Hejlsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg).

The popularity of TypeScript is
[rising rapidly](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/10-most-popular-programming-languages-rise-of-typescript/) and it
may very well, one day, become as popular as JavaScript itself.

#### Typical Industrial Use Cases

- Frontend web applications (i.e. constructing interactive data charts in the browser)
- Server-side web applications (via [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), soft real-time apps such as gathering live
  machine data from the floor)

### Rust Programming

#### Before You Begin

Coming soon!

#### Overview

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a systems programming language along the same lines as C and C++. A systems
programming language is suitable for building lower-level software platforms (i.e. game engines, operating systems,
industrial automation platforms) which are used by higher-level software directly exposed to users (i.e. computer games,
CAM systems, systems design tools).

However, Rust has some unique differences from more historical programming languages such as C and C++ - namely, it is
designed from the ground up to provide safe concurrency and better memory safety while achieving a high degree of
performance.

The lack of constructs to support safe memory guarantees are a major source of hard-to-catch bugs and significant
security issues in C and C++ even with highly experienced programmers. When one is dealing with industrial software,
security issues that might harm physical equipment or shut down production are to be avoided at all costs if possible.
Rust helps achieve that more "automatically".

Of course this does **not** mean that C and C++ knowledge is useless. Quite the contrary in fact. C and C++ have a
storied, proven and very successful history. C++ is [ISO standardized](https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard) and used
throughout many mission-critical systems in the manufacturing industry.

Rust is a young programming language in relative terms considering that it started development in 2010.

For new systems programming projects, Rust is definitely worth a look. In maintaining existing C/C++ codebases though, a
good working knowledge of C/C++ is extremely helpful even if some components can be written or migrated to Rust.

All of that said, Rust is
[growing in popularity](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages)
with the technology community and might one day rival the widespread use of C and C++.

#### Typical Industrial Use Cases

- Hard real-time operating systems
- Embedded operating systems for constrained devices (e.g. IIoT)
- Simulation and graphics engines
- Industrial control systems (e.g. CNCs, PLCs)
